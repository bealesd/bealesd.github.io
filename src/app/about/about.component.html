    <h1>Welcome, I'm David Beales</h1>

    <p> I'm a software developer at the UKHO, writing code in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, HTML, and PowerShell
        on a daily basis. I'm pretty sure this makes me a jack of all trades.</p>

    <p>This blog is mostly me writing software engineering notes for myself, when I get round to it! I'm trying to
        improve my posts as I write more, i.e. make them user friendly, assume less background knowledge, more graphics.
    </p>
