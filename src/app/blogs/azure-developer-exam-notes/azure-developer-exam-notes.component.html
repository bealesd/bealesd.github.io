<ul>
    <li>Connectors can provide triggers, actions, or both.</li>

    <li>Many triggers provided by the connectors include basic scheduling capabilities for regular workload runs</li>
    <li>When trigger fires, the Logic Apps engine creates a logic app instance that runs the actions in the workflow.
    </li>
    <li>Recurrence trigger: This trigger runs on a specified schedule and isn&#39;t tightly associated with a particular service or system.</li>
    <li>Polling trigger: This trigger regularly polls a specific service or system based on the specified schedule, checking for new data or whether a specific event happened. If new data is available or the specific event happened, the trigger creates and
        runs a new instance of your logic app, which can now use the data that&#39;s passed as input.</li>
    <li>Push trigger: This trigger waits and listens for new data or for an event to happen. When new data is available or when the event happens, the trigger creates and runs new instance of your logic app, which can now use the data that&#39;s passed as
        input.

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event producers or publisher: Any entity that sends data to an event hub. Event publishers can publish events using HTTPS to an event hub</li>
    <li>Partitions: Each consumer only reads a specific subset, or partition, of the message stream.</li>
    <li>Consumer groups: A view (state, position, or offset) of an entire event hub. Consumer groups enable consuming applications to each have a separate view of the event stream. They read the stream independently at their own pace and with their own offsets.</li>
    <li>Throughput units: Pre-purchased units of capacity that control the throughput capacity of Event Hubs.</li>
    <li>Event receivers: Any entity that reads event data from an event hub. The Event Hubs service delivers events through a session as they become available.</li>

<h2 id="event-hubs-dedicated">Event Hubs Dedicated</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Single-tenancy: A Dedicated cluster guarantees capacity at full scale, and can ingress up to gigabytes of streaming data with fully durable storage and sub-second latency to accommodate any burst in traffic.</li>
    <li>Access to features: The Dedicated offering includes features like Capture at no additional cost, as well as exclusive access to upcoming features like Bring Your Own Key (BYOK). The service also manages load balancing, OS updates, security patches
        and partitioning for the customer, so that you can spend less time on infrastructure maintenance and more time on building client-side features.</li>

<ul>
    <li>fully managed enterprise integration message broker</li>
    <li>decouple applications and services</li>
    <li>reliable and secure platform for asynchronous transfer of data and state.</li>
    <li>Data is transferred between different apps and services using messages</li>
    <li>A message is in binary format and can contain JSON, XML, or just text.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A namespace is a container for all messaging components.
        <ul>
            <li>Multiple queues and topics can be in a single namespace, and namespaces often serve as application containers.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="queues">Queues</h2>
<ul>
    <li>FIFO</li>
    <li>Messages are sent to and received from queues. </li>
    <li>Queues store messages until the receiving application is available to receive and process them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="topic">Topic</h2>
<ul>
    <li>You can also use topics to send and receive messages</li>
    <li>a queue is often used for point-to-point communication, topics are useful in publish/subscribe scenarios.</li>
    <li>Topics can have multiple, independent subscriptions</li>
    <li>A subscriber to a topic can receive a copy of each message sent to that topic.</li>
    <li>Subscriptions are named entities. Subscriptions persist, but can expire or autodelete.</li>
    <li>You may not want individual subscriptions to receive all messages sent to a topic. Use filters and rules to define conditions that trigger optional actions. You can filter specified messages and set or modify message properties.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="advanced-features">Advanced features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Dead-letter queue - holds messages that can&#39;t be delivered to any receiver.</li>
    <li>Message sessions - allow FIFO</li>
    <li>Autoforwarding - chains a queue or subscription to another queue or topic that is in the same namespace.</li>
    <li>Batching - delay sending a message for a certain period of time</li>
    <li>Scheduled delivery - delayed processing</li>
    <li>Message deferral - can defer retrieval of a message until a later time.</li>
    <li>Transactions - groups two or more operations together into an execution scope.</li>
    <li>Filtering and actions - Subscribers can define which messages they want to receive from a topic</li>
    <li>Duplicate detection - nables the sender to resend the same message, or discard any duplicate copies</li>
    <li>Autodelete on idle - idle interval after which a queue is automatically deleted.</li>
    <li>Security protocols: SAS, RBAC, Managed identities for azure resources</li>
    <li>Security: HTTP/REST protocols.</li>
    <li>Geo-disaster recovery: enables data processing to continue operating in a different region or datacenter.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="settling-receive-operations">Settling receive operations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>ReceiveAndDelete
        <ul>
            <li>tells the broker to consider all messages it sends to the receiving client as settled when sent</li>
            <li>That means that the message is considered consumed as soon as the broker has put it onto the wire</li>
            <li>If the message transfer fails, the message is lost.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>PeekLock
        <ul>
            <li>tells the broker that the receiving client wants to settle received messages explicitly</li>
            <li>message is made available for the receiver to process, while held under an exclusive lock in the service so that other, competing receivers cannot see it</li>

    </li>
    <li>Telemetry channels are an integral part of the Azure Application Insights SDKs</li>
    <li>Telemetry channels are responsible for buffering telemetry items and sending them to the Application Insights service
    </li>
    <li>The .NET and .NET Core versions of the SDKs have two built-in telemetry channels: InMemoryChannel and ServerTelemetryChannel.
    </li>
    <li>A telemetry channel is any class that implements the Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.ITelemetryChannel interface.
    </li>
    <li>InMemoryChannel: A lightweight channel that buffers items in memory until they&#39;re sent. Items are buffered in memory and flushed once every 30 seconds, or whenever 500 items are buffered.</li>
    <li>ServerTelemetryChannel: A more advanced channel that has retry policies and the capability to store data on a local disk. This channel retries sending telemetry if transient errors occur.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>An app that communicates with elements running in the cloud has to be sensitive to the transient faults that can occur in this environment. </li>
            <li>Faults include the loss of network connectivity to components and services, temporary unavailability of a service, or timeouts that occur when a service is busy.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="handling-transient-errors">Handling transient errors</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Cancel:
        <ul>
            <li>If the fault indicates that the failure isn&#39;t transient or is unlikely to be successful if repeated, the application should cancel the operation and report an exception.</li>
            <li>For example, an authentication failure caused by providing invalid credentials is not likely to succeed no matter how many times it&#39;s attempted.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Retry:
        <ul>
            <li>If the specific fault reported is unusual or rare, it might have been caused by unusual circumstances, such as a network packet becoming corrupted while it was being transmitted. </li>
            <li>In this case, the application could retry the failing request again immediately, because the same failure is unlikely to be repeated, and the request will probably be successful.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Retry after a delay:
        <ul>
            <li>If the fault is caused by one of the more commonplace connectivity or busy failures, the network or service might need a short period of time while the connectivity issues are corrected or the backlog of work is cleared.</li>
            <li>The application should wait for a suitable amount of time before retrying the request.</li>

<h1 id="azure-cache-for-redis">Azure Cache for Redis</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Caching is the act of storing frequently accessed data in memory that is very close to the application that consumes the data</li>
    <li>increase performance and reduce the load on your servers</li>
    <li>create an in-memory cache that can provide excellent latency and potentially improve performance</li>
    <li>accessible from any application within Azure</li>
    <li>typically used to improve the performance of systems that rely heavily on back-end data store</li>
    <li>cached data is located in-memory on an Azure server running the Redis cache</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-type-of-data-can-be-stored-in-the-cache">What type of data can be stored in the cache</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Binary-safe strings (most common)</li>
    <li>Lists of strings</li>
    <li>Unordered sets of strings</li>
    <li>Hashes</li>
    <li>Sorted sets of strings</li>
    <li>Maps of strings</li>
    <li>Each data value is associated to a key for value lookup in cache</li>
    <li>Redis works best with smaller values (100k or less),</li>
    <li>Storing larger values is possible (up to 500 MB), but increases network latency and can cause caching and out-of-memory issues if the cache isn&#39;t configured to expire old values.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-is-a-redis-key-">What is a Redis key?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>keys are also binary safe strings</li>
    <li>Avoid long keys.</li>
    <li>They take up more memory and require longer lookup times because they have to be compared byte-by-byte.</li>
    <li>You can use binary blob as the key, generate a unique hash and use that as the key instead. The maximum size of a key is 512 MB</li>
    <li>Use keys which can identify the data. For example, “sport:football;date:2008-02-02” would be a better key than &quot;fb:8-2-2&quot;.
    </li>
    <li>Use a convention. A good one is “object:id”, as in &quot;sport:football&quot;.</li>
    <li>Redis cache will need a globally unique name. </li>
    <li>The name has to be unique within Azure because it is used to generate a public-facing URL to connect and communicate with the service</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-is-data-stored-in-a-redis-cache-">How is data stored in a Redis cache?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Data in Redis is stored in nodes and clusters.</li>
    <li>Nodes are a space in Redis where your data is stored.</li>
    <li>Clusters are sets of three or more nodes your dataset is split across. Clusters are useful because your operations will continue if a node fails or is unable to communicate to the rest of the cluster.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="redis-caching-architectures">Redis caching architectures</h2>
<ul>
    <li>how we distribute our data in the cache</li>
    <li>redis distributes data in three major ways:
        <ol>
            <li>Single node</li>
            <li>Multiple node</li>
            <li>Clustered</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>caching architectures are split across Azure by tiers:
        <ul>
            <li>Basic cache:
                <ul>
                    <li>A basic cache provides you with a single node Redis cache. </li>
                    <li>The complete dataset will be stored in a single node. </li>
                    <li>This tier is ideal for development, testing, and non-critical workloads.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Standard cache:
                <ul>
                    <li>The standard cache creates multiple node architectures. </li>
                    <li>Redis replicates a cache in a two-node primary/secondary configuration. </li>
                    <li>Azure manages the replication between the two nodes.</li>
                    <li>This is a production-ready cache with master/slave replication.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Premium tier
                <ul>
                    <li>The premium tier includes the features of the standard tier but adds the ability to persist data, take snapshots, and back up data. </li>
                    <li>You can create a Redis cluster that shards data across multiple Redis nodes to increase available memory.</li>
                    <li>Supports an Azure Virtual Network to give you complete control over your connections, subnets, IP addressing, and network isolation. </li>
                    <li>Includes geo-replication, so you can ensure your data is close to the app that&#39;s consuming it.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sdk">SDK</h2>
<ul>

    </li>
    <li>connection: ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(connectionString)</li>
    <li>Redis database is represented by the IDatabase type</li>
